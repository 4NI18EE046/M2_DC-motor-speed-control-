# 4W's and 1H:
## What?
* The speed of the DC motor is controlled by the intensity of the light.
## Why?
* The objective of this project is to see how much faster the motor moves when a hand is brought closer to it.
## Where?
* This circuit could be very useful in applications where one tries to control the movement of a robot using a wired/wireless channel, keeping different arrangements of LDR and transmitting the same through the channel to the receiving side, where the movement of the robot can be controlled.
## Who?
* It is an automated detector, So no need for any manual involvement to reset to normal value so every one who needs can use it.
## How?
* A light-dependent resistor (LDR) whose resistance is inversely proportional to the intensity of light is often used as a sensor in electronic projects that involve the use of light. This LDR based DC motor speed control project uses an LDR to control the speed of a DC motor.
